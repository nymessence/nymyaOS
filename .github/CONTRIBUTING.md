Thanks for your interest in helping out! Whether you're reporting bugs, contributing code, or just sharing feedback, you're helping shape something special.

## Guidelines

- All core logic should be clean, portable C (C99 or later)
- Follow the naming scheme for syscall codes: `nymya_33xx_gate`
- Respect the separation of runtime vs syscall SDK
- Document mystical functions and metaphysical gates clearly
- Use metaphors responsibly (this is still real code)
