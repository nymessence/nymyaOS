# About Internship Credit

Hey there! If you’re currently in high school, community college, or a four-year university and hoping to get class credit for your Nymessence internship, here’s the deal:

**Your school is the one that decides whether the internship counts for credit.**  

We provide mentorship, guidance, and documentation for your internship experience. Your work is verified based on the type of tasks you do, coding work is verified through GitHub commit logs, while communications, social media, or other non-technical tasks are verified by emails, posts, and other relevant outputs.  

If your school asks for additional documentation, such as a letter of recommendation, feel free to reach out to us, we’ll be happy to help.  

Even if you’re not in school, anyone **16 or older with relevant skills** can join the internship. It doesn’t matter if you’re neurodivergent, have a physical disability, are from another country, or even another planet, everyone is welcome.  

You may remain in the internship for as long as you want. Staying longer is **recommended** if you are looking for additional credit or to build more experience for your resume or portfolio.  

While the internship is currently unpaid, check with your school to see if they offer stipends or scholarships for your internship. Additionally, doing research to find relevant grants may be another way to get paid for your work.  

Even if you might feel insignificant today, by doing this internship you are directly laying the groundwork for the techno-spiritual, post-capitalist world of tomorrow. The truth is, this world we want won’t be possible without your contribution, because we are not afraid to experiment with the cutting edge of quantum computing, AI, and consciousness.  

We cannot wait for someone else to lead us into the future we want. We have to work together ourselves, and it won’t be possible without collaboration.  

All interns are encouraged to list their Nymessence internship on their resume to highlight the skills and experience gained.
