.TH NYMYA_3301_IDENTITY_GATE 1 "2023-10-27" "nymyaOS Kernel Syscalls" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
nymya_3301_identity_gate \- apply the quantum identity gate (I) to a qubit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.In nymya.h
.Ft long
.Fn nymya_3301_identity_gate "struct nymya_qubit *user_q"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn nymya_3301_identity_gate
syscall applies the quantum identity gate (I) to a specified
.Fa user_q
structure. This operation is fundamentally symbolic; it does not alter the
amplitude or phase of the
.Fa nymya_qubit
but serves to log its current state as having undergone an identity transformation.
.P
In the grand tapestry of computational existence, this syscall represents not an alteration, but an affirmation, a moment where the subtle energies of a quantum state are observed and acknowledged, yet left undisturbed. It is a necessary pause, a beat in the rhythm of the hidden lattice of reality, ensuring that even in stasis, the flow of information is duly noted.
.P
The
.Fa user_q
argument is a pointer to a
.Ft struct nymya_qubit
residing in the caller's address space. The kernel reads this structure to extract
its identifying information (ID and tag) for logging purposes.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.Fn nymya_3301_identity_gate
syscall returns 0 on success.
.SH ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width ".Er EFAULT"
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa user_q
argument was NULL.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An attempt to copy the
.Ft struct nymya_qubit
from user space failed. This indicates a problem with the provided
address, such as it being outside the accessible user address space.
.El
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example demonstrates calling
.Fn nymya_3301_identity_gate
to mark a symbolic qubit's state.
.Pp
.Ex
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <nymya.h> // Assumed to define nymya_qubit and the syscall wrapper

// Define a dummy nymya_qubit for demonstration
// In a real nymyaOS system, this would be part of <nymya.h>
typedef struct {
    unsigned int id;
    unsigned int tag;
    // other symbolic quantum state variables could go here
} nymya_qubit;

// Assume this function is provided by nymya.h,
// wrapping the actual syscall(3301)
extern long nymya_3301_identity_gate(nymya_qubit *q);

int main() {
    nymya_qubit my_qubit = { .id = 42, .tag = 101 };
    long res;

    printf("Attempting to apply identity gate to qubit ID %u, Tag %u\\n",
           my_qubit.id, my_qubit.tag);

    res = nymya_3301_identity_gate(&my_qubit);

    if (res == 0) {
        printf("Identity gate applied successfully (symbolic event logged).\\n");
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error applying identity gate: %ld\\n", res);
        // In a real application, map error codes to human-readable messages
        if (res == -22) { // -EINVAL
            fprintf(stderr, "Reason: Invalid argument (NULL qubit pointer).\\n");
        } else if (res == -14) { // -EFAULT
            fprintf(stderr, "Reason: Bad address for qubit structure.\\n");
        }
    }

    return (int)res;
