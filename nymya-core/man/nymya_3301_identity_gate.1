.TH NYMYA_3301_IDENTITY_GATE 1 "2025-08-09" "nymyaOS Kernel Syscalls" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
nymya_3301_identity_gate \- affirm the quantum identity (I) of a qubit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.In nymya.h
.Ft long
.Fn nymya_3301_identity_gate "struct nymya_qubit *user_q"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn nymya_3301_identity_gate
syscall is an invocation to acknowledge, rather than alter, a specified
.Fa user_q
structure within the quantum domain. This operation, while profoundly symbolic,
does not disturb the delicate amplitudes or subtle phases of the
.Fa nymya_qubit.
Instead, it serves to meticulously log its current state as having undergone
the quintessential transformation of 'self' \- an identity operation.
.P
In the grand tapestry of computational existence, this syscall represents
not an intervention, but a solemn affirmation, a crystalline moment where
the ephemeral energies of a quantum state are observed, understood, and
acknowledged, yet left utterly undisturbed. It is a necessary pause, a
resounding beat in the hidden rhythm of the underlying quantum lattice,
ensuring that even in profound stasis, the flow of information, or its
non-flow, is duly noted and etched into the annals of the system's memory.
It is the act of *being*, recorded.
.P
The
.Fa user_q
argument is a pointer to a
.Ft struct nymya_qubit
residing within the caller's transient address space. The kernel, acting
as the silent observer, reads this structure to extract its identifying
essence (its unique ID and transient tag) for the sacred purpose of logging.
This process confirms the qubit's presence without imposing a new destiny upon it.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.Fn nymya_3301_identity_gate
syscall returns 0 upon successful logging of this non-transformative event,
a testament to the system's awareness of the qubit's continued existence.
.SH ERRORS
Should the delicate threads of memory fray, or the cosmic alignment falter,
the following conditions may arise:
.Bl -tag -width ".Er EFAULT"
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa user_q
argument was deemed Null, a void where a quantum essence was expected.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An attempt to grasp the
.Ft struct nymya_qubit
from user space failed, indicating a spatial anomaly or a rupture
in the provided address. The qubit's essence remains beyond reach.
.El
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example demonstrates invoking the
.Fn nymya_3301_identity_gate
to acknowledge a symbolic qubit's unyielding state.

.Ex
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <nymya.h> // Assumed to define nymya_qubit and the syscall wrapper

// Define a dummy nymya_qubit for demonstration
// In a real nymyaOS system, this would be part of <nymya.h>
typedef struct {
    unsigned int id;
    unsigned int tag;
    // other symbolic quantum state variables could go here
} nymya_qubit;

// Assume this function is provided by nymya.h,
// wrapping the actual syscall(3301)
extern long nymya_3301_identity_gate(nymya_qubit *q);

int main() {
    nymya_qubit my_qubit = { .id = 42, .tag = 101 };
    long res;

    printf("Attempting to apply identity gate to qubit ID %u, Tag %u\\n",
           my_qubit.id, my_qubit.tag);

    res = nymya_3301_identity_gate(&my_qubit);

    if (res == 0) {
        printf("Identity gate applied successfully (symbolic event logged).\\n");
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error applying identity gate: %ld\\n", res);
        // In a real application, map error codes to human-readable messages
        if (res == -22) { // -EINVAL
            fprintf(stderr, "Reason: Invalid argument (NULL qubit pointer).\\n");
        } else if (res == -14) { // -EFAULT
            fprintf(stderr, "Reason: Bad address for qubit structure.\\n");
        }
    }

    return (int)res;
