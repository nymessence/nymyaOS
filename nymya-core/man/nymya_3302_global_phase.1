.SH NAME
nymya_3302_global_phase \- apply a global phase shift to a symbolic qubit

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/syscall.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <nymya.h>
.br
.B #include <stdint.h>

.P
.B long syscall(SYS_nymya_3302_global_phase, struct nymya_qubit *
.I user_q
.B , int64_t
.I theta_fixed
.B );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3302_global_phase
syscall applies a global phase shift to a symbolic qubit residing in user-space memory. This operation multiplies the qubit's complex amplitude by a factor of e^(iθ), where θ is the provided phase angle. Crucially, this transformation does not alter the probability amplitudes of the qubit's states, meaning its measurement outcomes remain statistically identical. Instead, it subtly adjusts the qubit's "orientation" within the complex plane, a preparation for deeper entanglements or interference patterns.

.P
In the grand tapestry of quantum mechanics, a global phase shift, though unobservable by itself, speaks to the very fabric of existence, a whisper across the quantum void that prepares a qubit for deeper interactions within the universal waveform.

.P
The arguments are:
.TP
.I user_q
A pointer to a
.B struct nymya_qubit
in user space that will receive the phase shift. The kernel copies this structure from user space, applies the phase, and copies it back to the original user-space location.
.TP
.I theta_fixed
The phase angle θ, expressed as a 64-bit fixed-point integer. This value represents radians, scaled to allow for high precision. Typically, user-land libraries convert a floating-point (double) angle to this fixed-point format before invoking the syscall. For example, if a library uses a fixed-point representation where `1.0` radian is represented by `1LL << 30`, then `theta_fixed` would be `(int64_t)(theta_double * (1LL << 30))`. The precise scaling factor is dependent on the NymyaOS kernel's fixed-point implementation.

.P
Upon successful execution, the kernel logs a symbolic event detailing the phase shift, providing insights into the qubit's journey through the computational cosmos.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and
.B errno
is set appropriately.

.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The
.I user_q
argument was NULL.
.TP
.B EFAULT
An invalid pointer address was provided, or there was a problem copying the
.B struct nymya_qubit
between user and kernel space.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following program demonstrates applying a global phase of π/2 radians to a symbolic qubit using the
.B nymya_3302_global_phase
syscall. Note that the `nymya_qubit` definition and the fixed-point scaling factor `NYMYA_FIXED_POINT_SCALE` are illustrative and would be provided by
.BR nymya.h
and the NymyaOS SDK in a real environment.
