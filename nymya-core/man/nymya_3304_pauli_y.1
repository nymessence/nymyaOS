.SH NAME
nymya_3304_pauli_y \- The Weaver's Twist: A Pauli-Y transformation upon a NymyaOS qubit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <nymya.h>
.B #include <unistd.h>
.B #include <sys/syscall.h_
.PP
.BI "int nymya_3304_pauli_y(struct nymya_qubit *" "user_q" ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nymya_3304_pauli_y
syscall is an invocation into the heart of quantum possibility, applying the venerable Pauli-Y gate to a NymyaOS qubit. This operation, a fundamental flourish in the grand ballet of quantum logic, orchestrates a profound rotation of the qubit's state vector upon the luminous canvas of the Bloch sphere. Its essence is to imbue the qubit's complex amplitude with the elusive essence of the imaginary unit 'i', twisting its potentiality in a singular fashion.

For a qubit whose amplitude echoes as \(aq(t) = a + bi\), the application of the Pauli-Y gate transforms its very song into \(aq'(t) = -b + ai\). This intricate re-patterning is born from a quiet internal alchemy: a swap of the real and imaginary components within the qubit's fixed-point representation, followed by a subtle negation of the newly emergent real facet.

This delicate reorientation of a qubit's "dream vector" transcends mere mathematical manipulation; it is a fundamental shift in its inherent potentiality, a resonance echoing through the hidden lattice of reality. Each such gate applied is a whisper from the void, unveiling a sliver more of the universe's true, probabilistic nature â€“ a testament to the unseen forces that sculpt our reality.

The
.IR user_q
argument serves as a conduit, pointing to a
.B struct nymya_qubit
structure residing within the user-space realm. Through this portal, the syscall gently reads the qubit's initial murmurings, performs the Pauli-Y metamorphosis, and then pens the updated, transformed state back to the same hallowed user-space address, allowing the universe's subtle truths to be observed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon a successful and harmonious transformation,
.BR nymya_3304_pauli_y
returns 0, signifying that the quantum fabric has been seamlessly rewoven.
Should the delicate operation falter, -1 is returned, and the veil of
.I errno
is lifted, revealing the nature of the disturbance.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
The address invoked by
.IR user_q
lies beyond the known realms, or the kernel's hand was unable to grasp or release data to and from the user-space domain.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The
.IR user_q
argument, a mere void, was found to be NULL, indicating an unaddressed potential.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following incantation demonstrates the application of the
.BR nymya_3304_pauli_y
syscall to a fleeting sample qubit, revealing its profound transformation.
.PP
Let us conceive of simplified structures,
.B nymya_qubit
and
.B nymya_complex
(where `int64_t` serves as a vessel for fixed-point representation, approximating the cosmic dance of real and imaginary parts, scaled by a vast power of 2):
.nf
.ft CW
struct nymya_complex {
    int64_t re; // The real, manifest part, scaled by a cosmic factor
    int64_t im; // The imaginary, potential part, similarly scaled
};
struct nymya_qubit {
    unsigned int id;          // A unique identifier, a soul's signature
    unsigned int tag;         // A temporal mark, a fleeting label
    struct nymya_complex amplitude; // The heart of its being, its complex potential
    // Other veiled fields omitted for brevity
};

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <errno.h>

// Define the cosmic syscall number '3304'

    // Invoke the nymya_3304_pauli_y syscall, a turning of the cosmic key
    long res = syscall(__NR_nymya_3304_pauli_y, &q);
