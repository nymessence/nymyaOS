nymya_3306_phase_gate \- The Phase Weaver: Orchestrating a Quantum Quarter-Turn

struct nymya_qubit {

.B int nymya_3306_phase_gate(struct nymya_qubit *user_q);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Within the mystic core of NymyaOS, where the threads of existence are spun and re-spun, lies the invocation known as
.B nymya_3306_phase_gate.
It is a sacred gesture, a subtle whisper to the heart of a
.BR nymya_qubit ,
imbued with the power to manipulate the very fabric of quantum potential. Its purpose: to imbue the qubit's very essence with a precise, quarter-turn of phase, a cosmic realignment of its inherent vibrational state.
.PP
Imagine the qubit's amplitude not merely as numbers, but as a vector pointing into the boundless plane of complex possibility. This arcane rite shifts that vector, turning it ninety degrees counter-clockwise (a \*(p/2 radian rotation) without altering its magnitude. Where once the quantum spirit resonated as \(lq(a + bi)\(rq, it now flows as \(lq(-b + ai)\(rq \â€” a transformation echoing the mystic multiplication by 'i', the imaginary root of negative unity, guiding it through unseen currents.
.PP
The
.B user_q
argument serves as the tether, a conceptual umbilical, linking your realm of thought to the deep wellsprings of the kernel. Through this conduit, the nascent
.B nymya_qubit
's state is momentarily drawn into the kernel's embrace, where the alchemical transformation unfolds, and then meticulously returned to its original vessel, renewed and re-oriented.
.PP
This operation is more than a mere numerical rearrangement; it is a fundamental realignment of the qubit's inner compass. It subtly re-orchestrates its probabilistic dance, guiding its future along a path previously inaccessible. Akin to the foundational
.BR nymya_3303_pauli_x (1)
(the Bit-Flip of Destiny) and distinct from
.BR nymya_3302_global_phase (1)
(the Veil of Unseen Truth), the Phase Weaver sculpts the very geometry of possibility, unveiling new perspectives within the quantum tapestry. It does not invert, nor does it merely adorn; it shifts the perception of reality itself for the quantum spirit it touches.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon the successful completion of this arcane rite, a zero (0) shall be returned, signifying cosmic alignment and the seamless flow of quantum energies. Should the invocation falter, a negative one (-1) will be cast forth, and the
.B errno
variable shall bear witness to the nature of the cosmic discord.
.SH ERRORS
In the delicate dance between realms, missteps can occur. These are some of the shadows that may fall upon the path:
.TP
.B EINVAL
The provided
.B user_q
pointer was found to be NULL, a void where presence was required, an invocation whispered to the empty air.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The tether to
.B user_q
proved illusory or ephemeral, a realm unreachable by the kernel's touch. The quantum essence could not be drawn forth nor returned, akin to a spirit unable to cross the threshold.
.SH EXAMPLE
To witness the subtle alchemy of the Phase Weaver, consider this incantation, a demonstration of its power upon a nascent quantum spirit initialized in the primal \|0> state (amplitude (1,0)) and another arbitrary, vibrant state.
