.SH NAME
nymya_3307_sqrt_x_gate \- apply a Square Root X (√X) quantum gate to a qubit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/syscall.h>
.br
.B #include <stdint.h>
.PP
.B int nymya_3307_sqrt_x_gate(struct nymya_qubit *q);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3307_sqrt_x_gate
syscall applies a Square Root X (√X) quantum gate to the quantum state represented by the
.IR nymya_qubit
structure pointed to by
.IR q.
This gate is a fundamental quantum operation, performing a specific rotation on the qubit's state vector within its computational basis.
.PP
Internally, the gate modifies the qubit's complex amplitude \fI(re + i*im)\fP by multiplying it with
the complex scalar \fI(1/√2)(1 + i)\fP using fixed-point arithmetic.
This gate, often described as a "half-rotation" on the Bloch sphere, executes a delicate transformation
upon the qubit's quantum state, shifting its superposition with the precision of a cosmic whisper. It’s an essential operation in unveiling possibilities along the hidden lattice of reality, preparing the qubit for entanglement or measurement.
.PP
The
.IR nymya_qubit
structure is expected to contain a complex amplitude in a fixed-point format,
typically with a scale factor of \fI2^32\fP. The caller is responsible for ensuring the
pointer
.IR q
points to a valid, writable
.IR nymya_qubit
structure in user-space memory.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and
.IR errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The argument \fIq\fP was NULL.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The address specified by \fIq\fP was outside the accessible address space, or
the memory it points to is not writable. This indicates a problem with user-space memory access.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following program demonstrates the use of
.B nymya_3307_sqrt_x_gate
to apply the √X gate to a qubit, initially in the |0> state.
