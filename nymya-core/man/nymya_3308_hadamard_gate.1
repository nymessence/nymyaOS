.SH NAME
nymya_3308_hadamard_gate \- apply Hadamard transformation (amplitude scaling) to a qubit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <nymya.h>
.PP
.B int nymya_3308_hadamard_gate(nymya_qubit *q);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3308_hadamard_gate
syscall applies a specific transformation to the complex amplitude stored within a designated qubit structure. This operation scales both the real and imaginary components of the qubit's amplitude by a precise factor of 1/âˆš2 (approximately 0.7071).

While named for the Hadamard gate, a cornerstone operation in quantum computing renowned for its ability to generate superposition from classical states, this syscall specifically implements the amplitude scaling aspect. This scaling is a critical preliminary step in preparing a qubit for probabilistic exploration within the quantum realm, allowing its essence to ripple through the potential fabric of existence, ready for further intricate transformations.

The
.I q
argument points to a
.B nymya_qubit
structure in user-space. This structure is expected to encapsulate the qubit's essential properties, including a unique identifier, an optional tag, and a
.B nymya_complex
member representing its complex amplitude. The syscall meticulously reads the current amplitude from user-space, performs the fixed-point scaling calculation in kernel-space for precision, and then securely writes the modified amplitude back to the user-space structure.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B nymya_3308_hadamard_gate
returns 0.
On error, -1 is returned, and
.B errno
is set appropriately to indicate the specific issue.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The
.I q
argument provided was NULL, indicating an invalid or uninitialized qubit pointer.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The address pointed to by
.I q
was outside the accessible address space of the calling process, or there was a failure during the attempt to copy data to or from user-space.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following program demonstrates how to apply the amplitude scaling aspect of the Hadamard transformation to a qubit using the
.B nymya_3308_hadamard_gate
syscall.
