.SH NAME
nymya_3312_double_controlled_not \- The Triple Nexus of Inversion: a gate of conditional phase-shift within NymyaOS's quantum fabric
.SH SYNOPSIS
To invoke this primal force, one must understand its signature, a whispered incantation in the tongue of C.

.B #include <nymya.h>
.PP
The fundamental particle, a
.B nymya_qubit
within which the very probability of existence resides, held as a
.B double complex amplitude
— a dance of real and imaginary.
.nf
.B struct nymya_qubit {
.B     /* ... other fields ... */
.B     double complex amplitude; /* User-space representation of the qubit's state */
.B     /* ... other fields ... */
.B };
.fi
.PP
Then, the command itself, weaving three threads of quantum potential:
.nf
.B int nymya_3312_double_controlled_not(struct nymya_qubit *
.I qc1
.B , struct nymya_qubit *
.I qc2
.B , struct nymya_qubit *
.I qt
.B );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3312_double_controlled_not
syscall is an act of subtle alchemy, a turning of the unseen face of a designated target qubit. It applies a NOT operation, a mystical phase flip, effectively multiplying the amplitude of the target by -1. But this is no simple decree; it is a conditional rite.

The gate opens not by simple will, but by a dual-willed assent. The operation springs into being only if the amplitude magnitude of
.I both
control qubits (
.I qc1
and
.I qc2
) crests a hidden threshold, exceeding 0.5. In essence, it functions as a quantum Toffoli-like gate, but unlike the brute flip of bits, this is a more nuanced transformation: an inversion not of presence, but of the underlying resonance or phase of the target state, conditioned on the "active" states (the robust amplitudes) of its twin arbiters.

This operation, a subtle dance of amplitudes, resonates with the quantum whispers that underpin the very fabric of reality. It's a fundamental permutation within the NymyaOS quantum framework, allowing complex logical operations to be built from simple conditional transformations. The gate acts as a nexus, where the confluence of two probabilistic currents can flip the very echo of another, revealing how interconnected the hidden lattice of reality truly is.

The
.I qc1
and
.I qc2
arguments are pointers to the first and second control
.B nymya_qubit
structures, respectively. These are the twin arbiters, their magnitudes determining the fate of the third. The
.I qt
argument is a pointer to the target
.B nymya_qubit
structure, the canvas upon which their unified will, if aligned, shall be etched. These structures must be accessible from the caller's realm, their memory woven into the cosmic loom.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A return of zero signifies success, a harmonious alignment, the gate's will made manifest. A whisper of -1, however, denotes discord, a veil fallen, and the
.B errno
reveals the nature of the unfulfilled invocation.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
If the guiding pointers, those ethereal threads connecting the realm of thought to the quantum lattice, are severed or point to the void (
.B NULL
), the invocation dissolves into
.B EINVAL
, a testament to an ill-formed decree.
.TP
.B EFAULT
Should the memory's loom fail to weave the necessary connection, the kernel unable to traverse the chasm between the user's intent and the system's core,
.B EFAULT
arises – the quantum tapestry remains untroubled by the misstep.
.SH EXAMPLE
To witness this dance in the raw, behold this ritual of C code, where the subtle shifts of the quantum realm are laid bare through the Oracle's pronouncements.
