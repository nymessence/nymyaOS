.SH NAME
nymya_3325_xyz_entangle \- A Symphony of Intertwined Destinies: Forging the Quantum Bond between Two Qubits

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <nymya/syscalls.h>
.br
.B #include <nymya/qubit.h>
.PP
.B long nymya_3325_xyz_entangle(struct nymya_qubit *
.I q1
.B , struct nymya_qubit *
.I q2
.B , int64_t
.I fixed_theta
.B );

.SH DESCRIPTION
From the silent depths of the nymyaOS kernel, the
.B nymya_3325_xyz_entangle()
system call orchestrates a profound communion, weaving the very fabric of existence between two nymyaOS qubits. This is no mere manipulation; it is a ritual of unification, an XX+YY+ZZ entanglement that aligns their quantum whispers into a shared song, a destiny forever entwined.

Upon invocation, the kernel, a silent guardian of the quantum realm, draws forth the ephemeral essences of the
.I nymya_qubit
structures from the user's conscious space into its own profound depths. Here, amidst the unseen currents, a cosmic geometry unfolds: a delicate calculus of angles, born from fixed-point precision, culminates in a complex number â€“ a beacon of rotation, a spiral of influence.

This rotation is then applied with an exquisite balance: the first qubit's amplitude, its very probability-wave, receives a direct embrace from this complex number, while its counterpart, the second qubit, is touched by the conjugate, the mirrored echo of that same influence. Thus, their individual melodies merge into a harmonious chorus, their states no longer isolated but forever echoing one another. Finally, the rewoven threads of their being are returned, bearing the indelible mark of their shared journey.

This act, a precise sculpting of quantum amplitudes, allows two qubits to enter a state of shared destiny, mirroring the profound interconnectedness that is whispered through the very fabric of the quantum realm itself. A trace of this communion, a symbolic echo, is etched into the kernel's annals, for the universe, too, keeps its silent records.

The vessels for this sacred operation are:
.TP
.I q1
A pointer to the
.I nymya_qubit
structure representing the first nascent universe of potential in user space. Its quantum amplitudes shall be transformed, reflecting its new, entangled truth.
.TP
.I q2
A pointer to the
.I nymya_qubit
structure representing its counterpart, the second potential, awaiting the embrace of shared truth. It, too, will be irrevocably altered by this intimate bond.
.TP
.I fixed_theta
An
.B int64_t
value, a delicate measure of the entanglement's intimacy, expressed as an angle in the arcane Q32.32 fixed-point format. This format, where 32 bits chart the integer realm and 32 bits map the minute fractions, is the very curvature of their intended bond. To calibrate this cosmic dial from a standard floating-point angle (e.g., from a
.B double
in radians), one must multiply the
.B double
value by
.B (1LL << 32)
(which is 2^32), translating the continuous flow of mathematics into the precise, discrete language of the quantum machine.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, a whisper of harmony, a resonant '0', indicates the successful weaving of destinies.
Yet, should the threads resist, or the path be obscured, a shadowed negative integer returns, bearing the mark of dissonance, reflecting a truth unreached.

.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The chosen vessels were but phantoms, one or both of the user-space qubit pointers (
.I q1
or
.I q2
) were empty voids where a qubit should awaken.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The veil between realms proved too thin, or the cosmic messenger faltered, as an error occurred while attempting to copy the qubits' essence between user space and kernel space (e.g., a supplied address for a qubit structure was invalid or inaccessible by the kernel's hand).

.SH EXAMPLE
Behold, a ritual transcribed into mortal code, demonstrating how one might prepare the vessels and invoke the
.B nymya_3325_xyz_entangle()
call to sculpt a shared quantum reality.

This glimpse into the quantum forge uses a simplified `call_nymya_3325_xyz_entangle` function to
represent the syscall for demonstration purposes. In a true nymyaOS
environment, you would typically use a direct `syscall()` invocation with
the appropriate syscall number, or a provided C library wrapper function.
It also includes placeholder definitions for `nymya_qubit` and
`complex_double` which would be supplied by system headers like
`nymya/qubit.h`. Here, the abstract becomes manifest, the unseen becomes intertwined.
