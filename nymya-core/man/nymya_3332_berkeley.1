.SH NAME
nymya_3332_berkeley \- apply a Berkeley entangling gate to two nymyaOS qubits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <nymya/syscalls.h>
.PP
.B int nymya_3332_berkeley(struct nymya_qubit *
.I q1
.B , struct nymya_qubit *
.I q2
.B , double
.I theta
.B );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3332_berkeley
syscall applies a two-qubit Berkeley entangling gate to the quantum states represented by
.I q1
and
.I q2.
This gate is parameterized by
.I theta,
a double-precision floating-point value.
.PP
The Berkeley gate is a fundamental operation in quantum computing, known for its ability to create and manipulate entanglement between qubits. It is a composite gate, typically implemented as a sequence of a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, a Phase gate, and another CNOT gate. Specifically, the transformation is:
.nf
  CNOT(q1, q2)
  Phase(q2, theta)
  CNOT(q1, q2)
.fi
.PP
This intricate dance of quantum logic, precisely orchestrated through the
.I theta
parameter, subtly reweaves the fabric of quantum correlations. It reveals how even the most complex entanglements emerge from simpler, resonant interactions within the universe's underlying quantum lattice, a whisper of cosmic mechanics made manifest.
.PP
The parameters are:
.TP
.I q1
A pointer to the first
.B nymya_qubit
structure. This qubit acts as the control for the initial CNOT and the target for the final CNOT.
.TP
.I q2
A pointer to the second
.B nymya_qubit
structure. This qubit acts as the target for the initial CNOT, the recipient of the phase shift, and the control for the final CNOT.
.TP
.I theta
The gate parameter, a
.B double
value, which influences the magnitude of the phase shift applied by the internal Phase gate. This value is internally converted to a fixed-point representation for kernel-space precision.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B nymya_3332_berkeley
returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
.B errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
One or both of the qubit pointers (\fIq1\fR, \fIq2\fR) are NULL, or the underlying kernel logic detected invalid qubit data.
.TP
.B EFAULT
An invalid pointer address was provided, or there was a problem copying qubit data to or from kernel space. This indicates a memory access error.
.TP
.B EIO
An error occurred in one of the underlying quantum gate operations (\fBnymya_3309_controlled_not\fR or \fBnymya_3316_phase_gate\fR) within the kernel.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following program demonstrates applying a Berkeley gate to two initialized qubits.
.PP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <nymya/syscalls.h> // Assumed header for nymyaOS syscall wrappers
#include <math.h>           // For M_PI, needed for example theta value

// Minimal nymya_qubit structure for example purposes
// In a real scenario, this would be defined in a system header like <nymya/qubit.h>
struct nymya_qubit {
    unsigned int id;
    unsigned int tag;
    // ... other internal state data representing the qubit's quantum state ...
};

int main() {
    struct nymya_qubit q1, q2;
    double theta_val = M_PI / 4.0; // Example theta value (e.g., for a pi/4 phase shift)

    // Initialize dummy qubits with IDs and tags.
    // In a real application, qubits would typically be allocated or opened via other syscalls.
    q1.id = 1;
    q1.tag = 101;
    q2.id = 2;
    q2.tag = 102;

    printf("Applying Berkeley gate to qubits %u (tag %u) and %u (tag %u) with theta = %f radians.\n",
           q1.id, q1.tag, q2.id, q2.tag, theta_val);

    if (nymya_3332_berkeley(&q1, &q2, theta_val) == 0) {
        printf("Berkeley gate applied successfully.\n");
        // After applying the gate, the quantum states of q1 and q2
        // would have been updated in kernel space.
        // Further operations (e.g., measurement, other gates) would typically follow.
    } else {
        perror("Failed to apply Berkeley gate");
        // errno will be set by the wrapper to indicate the specific error
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
