.SH DESCRIPTION
Behold the invocation of
.B nymya_3335_dagwood
\-\- a profound incantation that unfolds a three-qubit conditional exchange, often whispered of as the 'Dagwood' gate, for its layered and decisive nature. This rite engages three elemental whispers, three
.IR nymya_qubit
structures, each a fleeting vessel of potential within the grand tapestry of NymyaOS:
.PP
One, a guiding star (\fIq1\fP), its luminous presence casting a shadow or light upon the path. The other two, twin potentials (\fIq2\fP and \fIq3\fP), await the subtle shift of destiny.
.PP
The essence of this decree lies in its conditional nature. Should the very being of \fIq1\fP \-\- its squared amplitude, its leaning towards the vibrant '1' state, as determined by the ancient threshold \-\- affirm its dominant presence, then \fIq2\fP and \fIq3\fP shall exchange their very essence. Their amplitudes, their probabilistic forms, intertwine in a cosmic embrace, a swap of their ethereal identities, guided by the venerable \fBnymya_3313_swap\fP.
.PP
But if \fIq1\fP's essence remains quiescent, dwelling below the threshold's decree, then the delicate interplay between \fIq2\fP and \fIq3\fP remains undisturbed. Their individual paths continue unwoven, their destinies uncrossed by this particular confluence.
.PP
This operation embodies a fundamental principle of quantum entanglement and control, where the very state of one entity dictates the interaction between others, mirroring the subtle interplay within the cosmic weave that binds disparate elements. From the ephemeral realm of user consciousness, the qubit's essence is drawn into the sacred kernel's heart, where the Dagwood's decree is enacted upon their true forms. Then, bearing their transformed or reaffirmed destinies, they return to the manifest world, their new probabilities unveiled.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful attunement, a zero, signifying cosmic harmony and the fulfillment of the decree, is returned. Should discord arise, a negative unity is cast forth, and the Scroll of Errors (\fIerrno\fP) is inscribed with the nature of the disturbance.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The very vessels of interaction (\fIq1\fP, \fIq2\fP, or \fIq3\fP) were found to be mere echoes, lacking true form or substance, unworthy of the grand design.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The bridge between the realms \-\- user and kernel \-\- crumbled, denying the flow of essence, or the sacred permissions were withheld, preventing the qubits from entering or returning from the inner sanctum.
.TP
.B EIO
A deeper tremor shook the very foundations of the NymyaOS cosmos, an unrecoverable rift in the underlying weave. Perhaps even the venerable \fBnymya_3313_swap\fP itself faltered, leaving the involved qubits in an indeterminate void.
.SH EXAMPLE
A ritual of demonstration, unveiling the dance of the
.B nymya_3335_dagwood
gate. Assume the fundamental structures of \fBnymya_qubit\fP and \fBcomplex_double\fP are known, and the necessary ancient scrolls are included.
