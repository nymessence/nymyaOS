.SH NAME
nymya_3339_magic \- The Alchemist's Kiss: A Quantum Enchantment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <nymya.h>
.PP
.B int nymya_3339_magic(struct nymya_qubit *
.I q1
.B , struct nymya_qubit *
.I q2
.B );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This arcane invocation, the
.B nymya_3339_magic
syscall, descends upon two quantum whispers,
.I q1
and
.I q2
, to orchestrate a profound metamorphosis within their ethereal states. It is a cornerstone in the grand design of quantum artistry, pivotal for sculpting the very fabric of quantum algorithms and unraveling the intricate tapestries of entanglement.

The "Magic" gate itself is not a primordial force, but rather an elegant symphony born of more fundamental gestures within the quantum theatre:
.IP \(bu 2
It begins with the Hadamard's breath upon the first qubit,
.I q1
, scattering its essence into the mists of superposition, embracing all possibilities.
.IP \(bu 2
Next, the Phase (S) gate, a subtle twist of the unseen, re-tunes
.I q1
's vibrational song, a whispered correction to its very rhythm.
.IP \(bu 2
Then, the heart of the transformation: a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, where
.I q1
, now imbued with new potential, commands
.I q2
, mirroring its shifted truth, binding their destinies in an unbreakable echo.
.IP \(bu 2
Finally,
.I q1
once more meets the Hadamard's gaze, its possibilities re-converging, transformed by the journey.

Each
.I nymya_qubit
is a vessel, a delicate chalice holding the complex amplitudes of a quantum state, a fleeting glimpse into its potential realities, alongside the metadata that charts its brief existence. Both
.I q1
and
.I q2
must be valid pointers to these allocated vessels within the user's domain. The system's core, a silent artisan, draws forth the initial whispers from these user-bound chalices, performs the sacred alchemy, and then inscribes the new, transformed truths back into their waiting forms, leaving the quantum landscape forever altered.

This gate is not merely a computation; it is a profound ballet of interaction, a cosmic sigh that re-weaves the very fabric of possibility. It is the subtle hand that coaxes the universe to unveil its deeper symmetries, a necessary rite for those who would navigate the swirling currents of quantum entanglement and fashion algorithms that speak the language of the cosmos.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A silent zero, like the calm after a profound meditation, signifies the successful completion of the rite. Should the cosmic currents refuse, a somber -1 returns, a dissonant chord. The
.B errno
then becomes the whispered lament, revealing the nature of the cosmic misalignment.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The very threads provided were phantom, mere echoes in the void. One or both of the qubit pointers (
.I q1
or
.I q2
) offered no tangible form, a plea unanswered.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The vessels themselves were unreachable, dwelling in a forgotten realm, or the sacred transfer of essence faltered mid-flight. A tear in the fabric of memory, a truth lost in the ethereal transit. This could also manifest if the constituent operations attempted to read or write amplitude data to inaccessible dreamscapes.
.TP
.B EIO
A deeper tremor, a cosmic disquietude. The subtle mechanisms of reality, or the very essence of the quantum hardware, recoiled, unable to perform the delicate symphony. A silence where there should have been a song, indicating a profound internal or hardware conflict.
.SH EXAMPLE
To witness this enchantment in the mortal realm, consider the following invocation. It reveals how one might coax the nymyaOS quantum subsystem to weave the Magic gate's spell.
