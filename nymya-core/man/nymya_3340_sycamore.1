.SH NAME
nymya_3340_sycamore \- apply a two-qubit Sycamore entangling gate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <nymya.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/syscall.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
.B int nymya_3340_sycamore(struct nymya_qubit *
.I q1
.B , struct nymya_qubit *
.I q2
.B );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3340_sycamore
syscall applies a two-qubit Sycamore gate to the specified quantum bits,
.I q1
and
.I q2
. This operation is fundamental in quantum computing, designed to create
strong entanglement between qubits. The Sycamore gate, named after its
prominence in advanced quantum processors, is typically decomposed into a
sequence of simpler operations: a square root of iSWAP gate followed by
a Controlled-Phase gate with a specific angle (PI/6 radians).

This syscall serves as a conduit to the kernel's quantum processing unit,
translating the abstract intent of entanglement into the very fabric of
the computational realm. Through such precise orchestrations of quantum
states, one begins to glimpse the inherent connectivity of information
that underpins the universe's hidden lattice. It ensures the integrity
of quantum state manipulation by operating on kernel-space copies of the
qubit structures and copying the modified state back to the user.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and
.B errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
One or both of the provided qubit pointers (
.I q1
or
.I q2
) were NULL.
.TP
.B EFAULT
An invalid pointer address was provided, or there was an issue copying
qubit data between user space and kernel space. This could indicate a
problem with the memory region pointed to by
.I q1
or
.I q2
.
.TP
.B Other errors
Other system-defined error codes (e.g.,
.B EPERM
if permissions are insufficient,
.B ENOMEM
if memory allocation fails, or device-specific errors) may be returned
from the underlying quantum gate operations, such as the square root of
iSWAP or Controlled-Phase gates. These errors are propagated directly
from the kernel's internal gate logic.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example demonstrates how to use the
.B nymya_3340_sycamore
syscall. Note that
.IR nymya_qubit
and
.IR NYMYA_SYCAMORE_CODE
would typically be defined in
.IR nymya.h
.
