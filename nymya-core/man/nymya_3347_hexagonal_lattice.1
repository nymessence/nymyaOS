.SH NAME
nymya_3347_hexagonal_lattice \- apply hexagonal lattice operations to qubits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <nymya.h>
.PP
.B int nymya_3347_hexagonal_lattice(nymya_qubit *q[6]);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3347_hexagonal_lattice
syscall, identified by syscall number 3347, applies a predefined sequence of
quantum operations to six
.B nymya_qubit
objects. These operations are designed to arrange and entangle the qubits
into a specific hexagonal lattice configuration. This syscall is a
cornerstone for establishing complex entangled states vital for advanced
quantum algorithms and simulations within the nymyaOS environment.
.PP
The operational sequence, executed entirely within the kernel's secure
quantum processing unit, proceeds as follows:
.RS
.IP \(bu 1n
A Hadamard gate is applied to each of the six qubits independently.
.IP \(bu 1n
Subsequently, Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates are applied between adjacent
qubits in a cyclic manner. Specifically, a CNOT gate is performed
from qubit
.I q[i]
(control) to qubit
.I q[(i+1)%6]
(target) for all
.I i
from 0 to 5. This ensures a symmetrical entanglement across the ring.
.RE
.PP
From the user's perspective, the
.I q
argument is an array of six pointers, each referencing a
.B nymya_qubit
structure located in user space. The syscall transparently handles the
secure and efficient copying of these qubit structures from user space to
kernel space, executes the defined quantum operations, and then copies
the modified state of the qubits back to user space. It is within these
precisely engineered, ephemeral geometric configurations that the universe's
quantum whispers coalesce, revealing the profound patterns woven into the
hidden lattice of reality itself.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The
.I q
array pointer itself was NULL, or any of the six individual
.B nymya_qubit
pointers within the array were NULL. This indicates an invalid
argument provided by the user application.
.TP
.B EFAULT
A problem occurred during data transfer between user space and kernel space.
This error is returned if the initial array of qubit pointers cannot be
copied from user space, or if the actual
.B nymya_qubit
data structures cannot be copied into or out of kernel memory at any stage
of the operation.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available to allocate temporary qubit
structures required for processing the operation.
.TP
Other negative error codes may be propagated from underlying quantum gate
operations performed by the kernel, such as those from
.BR nymya_3308_hadamard_gate (2)
or
.BR nymya_3309_controlled_not (2),
if these internal operations encounter an error during execution.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example demonstrates how to initialize six
.B nymya_qubit
structures in user space and apply the hexagonal lattice operation using
the
.B nymya_3347_hexagonal_lattice
syscall.
.PP
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.B #include <errno.h>
.B #include <nymya.h> // Assuming nymya_qubit and relevant headers are here
.PP
.B int main() {
.B     nymya_qubit *q[6];
.B     int i;
.B     int ret;
.PP
.B     // Initialize 6 nymya_qubit structures
.B     for (i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
.B         q[i] = (nymya_qubit *)malloc(sizeof(nymya_qubit));
.B         if (!q[i]) {
.B             perror("Failed to allocate qubit memory");
.B             for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) free(q[j]);
.B             return 1;
.B         }
.B         // Assuming nymya_qubit_init or similar function
.B         // For this example, we manually set some basic fields.
.B         // In a real nymyaOS system, qubits would be initialized via other syscalls.
.B         q[i]->id = 1000 + i;
.B         q[i]->tag = 0xAA; // Example tag
.B         // Assume state vector for qubit is initialized to |0> for example
.B         // e.g., q[i]->state[0] = 1.0; q[i]->state[1] = 0.0;
.B     }
.PP
.B     printf("Attempting to apply hexagonal lattice operation to 6 qubits...\en");
.B     ret = nymya_3347_hexagonal_lattice(q);
.PP
.B     if (ret == 0) {
.B         printf("Hexagonal lattice operation successful! Qubits are now entangled.\en");
.B         // Further operations, e.g., reading qubit states, could follow here
.B         // using functions like nymya_read_qubit_state(q[0]->id, &state_out);
.B     } else {
.B         fprintf(stderr, "Error applying hexagonal lattice: %s (errno %d)\en",
.B                 strerror(errno), errno);
.B         return 1;
.B     }
.PP
.B     // Clean up allocated memory for qubits
.B     for (i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
.B         free(q[i]);
.B     }
.PP
.B     return 0;
