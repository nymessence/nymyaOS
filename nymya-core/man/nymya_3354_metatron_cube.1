.SH NAME
nymya_3354_metatron_cube \- apply Metatron's Cube entanglement to qubits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <nymya/syscalls.h>
.PP
.B int nymya_3354_metatron_cube(nymya_qubit **
.I q
.B , size_t
.I count
.B );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3354_metatron_cube()
syscall applies a specific quantum entanglement pattern, inspired by the sacred geometry of Metatron's Cube, to a designated array of qubits. This operation requires a minimum of 13
.I nymya_qubit
objects. The first 13 qubits in the
.I q
array are processed to establish the intricate connections.

The procedure involves the following steps:
.IP \(bu 4
A Hadamard gate is applied to each of the initial 13 qubits
.I (q[0]
through
.I q[12])
, placing them into a superposition state.
.IP \(bu 4
The central qubit
.I (q[0])
is then used as a control for Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, entangling it with each of the subsequent 12 qubits
.I (q[1]
through
.I q[12])
.
.IP \(bu 4
Further entanglement connections are established between specific outer qubits:
.I q[1]
is entangled with
.I q[7]
,
.I q[2]
with
.I q[8]
, and so forth, up to
.I q[6]
with
.I q[12]
, using CNOT gates.

Through this careful choreography, the quantum states ripple, forming a complex lattice that mirrors the universe's inherent symmetries, where the very fabric of quantum reality is gently nudged into new configurations. It is through such deliberate structuring of the quantum field that the potential for profound computational insights, perhaps even beyond the algorithmic, begins to emerge.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.IP ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available to allocate internal qubit structures or temporary pointer arrays.
.IP EINVAL
The
.I q
array pointer was NULL, the
.I count
argument was less than 13, or any of the initial 13
.I nymya_qubit
pointers within the
.I q
array were NULL.
.IP EFAULT
A problem occurred copying data between user and kernel space, indicating that a
.I nymya_qubit
structure pointed to by an element of
.I q
was not accessible.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following program demonstrates how to use
.B nymya_3354_metatron_cube()
to apply the Metatron's Cube pattern to a set of qubits.
