.SH NAME
nymya_3355_fcc_lattice \- simulate quantum operations on qubits arranged in an FCC lattice
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <nymya.h>
.B #include <unistd.h>
.PP
.B int nymya_3355_fcc_lattice(nymya_qpos3d *qubits, size_t count);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3355_fcc_lattice
syscall (number 3355) simulates a sequence of quantum operations on a collection of qubits, conceptually arranged within a three-dimensional Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice structure. This operation, drawing from the fundamental geometry of the Face-Centered Cubic lattice, is thought by Nya Elyria to delve into the subtle interplay of quantum states, echoing the very structure of the cosmos itself.

The
.I qubits
argument is a pointer to an array of
.B nymya_qpos3d
structures. Each structure typically contains a quantum state (`q`) and its conceptual spatial coordinates (`x`, `y`, `z`). The
.I count
argument specifies the number of qubits in the array. A minimum of 14 qubits is required for the operation to proceed.

The simulation proceeds as follows:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
A Hadamard gate operation is applied to each individual qubit in the array, placing them into a superposition of states.
.IP \(bu 2
For every unique pair of qubits (A, B), if the squared Euclidean distance between their `(x, y, z)` coordinates is less than or equal to a predefined threshold (approximately 1.0201 units squared in scaled fixed-point coordinates), a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operation is applied. This entangles the states of proximal qubits, reflecting their inherent quantum relationships within the lattice.
.RE

The
.I qubits
array serves as both input and output; upon successful completion, the `q` (quantum state) and `x, y, z` (position) fields of the structures within the array are updated to reflect the results of the simulated quantum operations. The coordinates are handled internally using fixed-point arithmetic for precision and efficiency, with automatic scaling by the userland wrapper.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned in the userland wrapper, and
.B errno
is set appropriately to indicate the error. Kernel-level errors (those directly from the syscall) return a negative error number.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The
.I qubits
argument is a NULL pointer, or the
.I count
argument is less than 14.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available to perform the operation.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The
.I qubits
array could not be copied from user space to kernel space, or copied back from kernel space to user space (e.g., due to a bad address or invalid permissions).
.TP
.B EIO
An error occurred during one of the underlying quantum gate operations (e.g.,
.BR nymya_3308_hadamard_gate (2) or
.BR nymya_3309_controlled_not (2) returned an error during processing).
.SH EXAMPLE
The following program demonstrates the use of
.B nymya_3355_fcc_lattice
to simulate operations on a small array of qubits.
