.SH NAME
nymya_3356_hcp_lattice \- perform quantum entanglement on a hexagonal close-packed lattice of qubits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <nymya.h>
.B #include <unistd.h>
.PP
.B int nymya_3356_hcp_lattice(nymya_qpos3d *
.I qubits
.B , size_t
.I count
.B );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nymya_3356_hcp_lattice
syscall is an invocation to the NymyaOS quantum kernel, designed to entangle a collection of
.BR nymya_qubit
entities based on their spatial proximity, mimicking the structure of a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice.
.PP
The
.I qubits
argument points to an array of
.BR nymya_qpos3d
structures, each containing a
.BR nymya_qubit
and its associated 3D coordinates (x, y, z). The
.I count
argument specifies the number of elements in this array.
.PP
Upon invocation, this syscall delves into the very fabric of reality, orchestrating a ballet of quantum states. It first applies a Hadamard transformation to each individual qubit within the array, preparing them for superposition. Subsequently, it weaves a tapestry of entanglement by applying Controlled-NOT (CNOT) operations between those qubits deemed "proximal" \- specifically, where their spatial coordinates indicate they are within a small, predefined epsilon distance of each other. This process establishes a resonance of quantum whispers across the hidden lattice of existence itself.
.PP
The
.I qubits
array serves as both the input blueprint and the vessel for the transformed quantum state; the quantum state of each
.BR nymya_qubit
will be modified in place according to the entanglement operations performed. The spatial coordinates, however, remain unchanged.
.PP
A minimum of 17 qubits are required for this syscall to proceed, reflecting the intricate minimal structure necessary for meaningful HCP lattice entanglement.
.PP
For context, the `nymya_qubit` and `nymya_qpos3d` structures are defined in `<nymya.h>` as follows:
.nf
.RS
typedef struct {
    uint64_t id;    // Unique identifier for the qubit
    uint8_t  state; // Internal state representation (e.g., 0, 1, superposition)
    uint8_t  tag;   // User-defined tag
    // ... other internal quantum properties
} nymya_qubit;

typedef struct {
    nymya_qubit q;  // The quantum bit itself
    double      x;  // X-coordinate in 3D space
    double      y;  // Y-coordinate in 3D space
    double      z;  // Z-coordinate in 3D space
} nymya_qpos3d;
.RE
.fi
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned. On error, \-1 is returned, and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.IP
.B EINVAL
The
.I qubits
pointer was NULL, or the
.I count
was less than 17.
.IP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available to allocate temporary buffers required for the operation.
.IP
.B EFAULT
An invalid pointer was passed for
.I qubits
, or the kernel encountered an error copying data to or from user space.
.IP
Other errors may be propagated from underlying quantum operations, such as
.BR nymya_3308_hadamard_gate (2)
or
.BR nymya_3309_controlled_not (2),
if an internal qubit state or ID is deemed invalid during processing.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following C code demonstrates how to prepare and invoke the
.BR nymya_3356_hcp_lattice
syscall.
.nf
.RS
#include <nymya.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h> // For strerror

#define NUM_QUBITS 20 // Must be >= 17

int main() {
    nymya_qpos3d qubits[NUM_QUBITS];

    // Initialize dummy qubit data and positions
    for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_QUBITS; i++) {
        qubits[i].q.id = 1000 + i;
        qubits[i].q.state = 0; // Or some initial state
        qubits[i].q.tag = (uint8_t)(i % 5);
        qubits[i].x = (double)i * 1.0;
        qubits[i].y = (double)i * 0.5;
        qubits[i].z = (double)i * 0.25;
    }

    printf("Attempting to entangle %zu qubits...\n", (size_t)NUM_QUBITS);

    int ret = nymya_3356_hcp_lattice(qubits, NUM_QUBITS);

    if (ret == 0) {
        printf("HCP lattice entanglement successful.\n");
        // Qubit states in 'qubits' array are now entangled.
        // Further operations could read or operate on these states.
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "HCP lattice entanglement failed: %s (errno %d)\n",
                strerror(errno), errno);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
