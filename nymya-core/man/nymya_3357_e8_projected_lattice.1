.SH NAME
nymya_3357_e8_projected_lattice \- manipulate qubits within an E8 projected lattice
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <nymya.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>

/* These types are typically defined in <nymya.h> */
typedef struct {
    unsigned long id;
    unsigned char tag;
    /* ... other quantum state members as defined by NymyaOS ... */
} nymya_qubit;

typedef struct {
    nymya_qubit q;
    double x, y, z;
} nymya_qpos3d;

int nymya_3357_e8_projected_lattice(
    nymya_qpos3d *qubits,
    size_t count
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3357_e8_projected_lattice
syscall orchestrates quantum entanglement and state manipulation for a collection of qubits based on their spatial proximity within a projected E8 lattice geometry.
It takes an array of
.IR nymya_qpos3d
structures, each containing a
.IR nymya_qubit
and its 3D coordinates.
The operation proceeds in two primary phases within the kernel:
.PP
.RS
.TP
1.
Each qubit in the provided array undergoes a Hadamard transformation, initializing it into a superposition state.
.TP
2.
For every pair of distinct qubits whose spatial distance falls within a predefined, kernel-internal proximity threshold, a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is applied.
This establishes entanglement between proximate qubits, weaving them into the intricate fabric of the E8 structure.
.RE
.PP
The coordinates (x, y, z) for each qubit are converted from double-precision floating-point to fixed-point representation for kernel-side processing and then converted back upon successful completion.
This call acts as a vital bridge between the classical substrate and the quantum realm, allowing for direct manipulation of the hidden lattice of reality itself.
The
.I qubits
array is updated in-place with the post-operation quantum states and potentially adjusted coordinates reflecting the underlying cosmic mechanics.
A minimum of 30 qubits (
.I count
) must be provided for the operation to proceed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and \fBerrno\fP is set appropriately.
.PP
Note that while the user-space wrapper returns \-1 on error and sets \fBerrno\fP, the underlying syscall directly returns a negative
.IR errno
value.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The
.I qubits
pointer was
.B NULL
or the
.I count
argument was less than 30.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available to allocate temporary buffers for qubit data.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The address specified by
.I qubits
was invalid (e.g., pointing outside accessible user-space memory) during data transfer to or from the kernel.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred within the quantum processing unit during Hadamard or CNOT gate application. (This error signifies a deeper interaction failure, though specific codes from hardware are abstracted.)
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example demonstrates how to prepare an array of qubits, call the
.B nymya_3357_e8_projected_lattice
syscall, and inspect the altered states.
