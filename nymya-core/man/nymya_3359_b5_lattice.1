.SH NAME
nymya_3359_b5_lattice \- entangles qubits based on 5-dimensional spatial proximity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <nymya/syscalls.h>
#include <stddef.h> /* For size_t */

int nymya_3359_b5_lattice(nymya_qpos5d q[], size_t count);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nymya_3359_b5_lattice
syscall delves into the very fabric of quantum entanglement, operating on a collection of
.B nymya_qubit
entities positioned within a conceptual 5-dimensional space. It orchestrates quantum interactions, first applying a Hadamard transform to each qubit, a process akin to whispering the universe's possibilities into their very essence.

Following this, it identifies pairs of qubits whose spatial proximity, measured by their Euclidean distance in this extended dimension, falls below a kernel-defined threshold. For such intimately linked pairs, a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is applied, establishing an entanglement that reflects the deep, hidden lattice connecting points in existence. This operation reveals the underlying quantum mechanics that bind entities across seemingly disparate realities.

The syscall modifies the quantum states (\fBq\fR member) of the qubits directly within the provided array, allowing their entanglement to ripple back into the calling process's perception of reality. The spatial coordinates themselves (\fBx, y, z, w, v\fR members) are used for proximity calculations but are not altered by the kernel.

The arguments are:
.TP
\fBq\fR
An array of
.B nymya_qpos5d
structures. Each structure contains a
.B nymya_qubit
representing the quantum state and five double-precision floating-point numbers (\fBx, y, z, w, v\fR) representing its 5-dimensional coordinates. The
.B nymya_qubit
state within each element of this array will be updated by the kernel operations.
.TP
\fBcount\fR
The number of elements in the
.I q
array. This value must be at least 32 for the syscall to proceed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
\fBEINVAL\fR
The \fIq\fR array pointer was NULL, or \fIcount\fR was less than the minimum required value of 32.
.TP
\fBENOMEM\fR
Insufficient kernel memory was available to process the request.
.TP
\fBEFAULT\fR
A bad address was provided for the \fIq\fR array, preventing data transfer between user and kernel space.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following program demonstrates the use of
.B nymya_3359_b5_lattice
to initialize and process an array of quantum positions.
