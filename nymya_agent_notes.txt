Based on the user's request, I will plan the steps to go to the `nymya_runtime` folder, check for and fix any build errors or bugs, and use `compile_local.sh` to compile.

**Shell commands (to run):**

1. `cd nymya_runtime`
2. `bash compile_local.sh`

**Files to edit:**

None

**Additional steps:**

1. Run the command `cd nymya_runtime` to change into the `nymya_runtime` directory.
2. Run the command `bash compile_local.sh` to compile the project using the local build script.

User asked: got to folder nymya-core and run compile_arm64_raspi.sh as we are working on a rasperry pi but first check the man folder with manpage docs. specifically we need to fix man page linking such that when a command after installing is run like "man nymya_3303_paule that you womt be able to test fully as you will need root access to install.

Based on the user's request, I plan the steps to go to the `nymya-core` folder, check the man page documents, and fix the linking issues. Here are the planned steps:

**Shell commands (to run):**

1. `cd nymya-core`
2. `ls man` (list the contents of the `man` directory)
3. `find . -name "man.*" -exec mv {} manpages \;` (move manpage files to a new directory called `manpages`)
4. `mkdir manlinks` (create a new directory for linking man pages)
5. `cd manlinks`
6. `ln -s ../../../nymyaOS-motd.sh mannymotd` (link the `nymymotd` script to the `man` directory)
7. `chmod +x nynmotd` (make the linked file executable)
8. `bash compile_arm64_raspi.sh` (compile and install the project using the Raspberry Pi build script)

**Files to edit:**

1. None

**Additional steps:**

1. Run the command `cd nymya-core` to change into the `nymya-core` directory.
2. Check the contents of the `man` directory using `ls man`.
3. Move the manpage files to a new directory called `manpages`.
4. Create a new directory for linking man pages and move the necessary files there.
5. Link the `nymymotd` script to the `man` directory and make it executable.
6. Run the `compile_arm64_raspi.sh` script to compile and install the project using the Raspberry Pi build script.
